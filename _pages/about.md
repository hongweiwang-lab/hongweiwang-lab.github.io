{This personal site is still under construction. hahhaa! Almost there… check back later! -Hongwei}

I am a Senior Scientist currently at the Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore. 

Before joining A*STAR, I worked as a Research Scientist in the Perception Department at Autonomous Driving Solution and in Scenario Research at Smart Transportation Solution, Huawei, Beijing. There, I contributed to autonomous driving through behavior intention modeling and trajectory prediction using large-scale Transformer models, as well as to smart transportation by optimizing charging scheduling for electric buses and designing vehicle–road collaboration systems. I also served as a research intern at DiDi Chuxing’s Smart Transportation Lab, where I worked on graph neural network models for transportation resilience.

I received my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering (intelligent transportation) from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by Prof. Zhong-Ren Peng. As part of my doctoral research, I was also a two-year joint Ph.D. student in Civil Engineering at the University of Florida, sponsored by the China Scholarship Council (CSC). I also earned my B.S. in Transportation Engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University.

My research spans several areas: AI-Driven Prediction & Optimization for Complex Systems, Prediction and Planning for Electrified & Autonomous Transportation, and Data-Driven Spatiotemporal Modeling for Resilient and Energy-Efficient Transportation. I am passionate about leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance learning, prediction, and optimization in complex transportation systems, including autonomous and electric transport across urban, airport, and maritime scenarios, ultimately aiming to improve intelligence, resilience, and energy efficiency. I am always open to new collaborations and interdisciplinary research opportunities—feel free to reach out if you’re interested in exploring innovative ideas in AI-driven transportation and complex systems.

			<td colspan="5"><div align="justify"> <b>Abstract</b>: At the intersection of artificial intelligence and urban development, this paper unveils the pivotal role of Foundation Models (FMs) in revolutionizing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Against the backdrop of escalating urbanization and environmental concerns, we rigorously assess how FMs—spanning large language models, vision-language models, large multimodal models, etc.—can redefine urban mobility paradigms. Our discussion extends to the potential of modular, scalable models and strategic public-private partnerships in facilitating seamless integration. Through a comprehensive literature review and theoretical framework, this paper underscores the significant role of FMs in steering the future of transportation towards unprecedented levels of intelligence and responsiveness. The insights offered aim to guide policymakers, engineers, and researchers in the ethical and effective adoption of FMs, paving the way for a new era in transportation systems.</div></td>
